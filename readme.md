# Deadlines
A web calendar-like schedule management app developed using ReactJS and Typescript.

In line with Doug McIlroy's Unix Philosophy,"Make each program do one thing well",modern schedule management applications often offer excessive and unnecessary features,and several of them are developed as components of larger applications.Thanks to Mozilla, Google, and Microsoft,the operating system abstraction provided by browsers allows me to rapidly create cross-platform tools on the web.Using ReactJS and Typescript,**Deadlines** is a web calendar-like schedule management app.
